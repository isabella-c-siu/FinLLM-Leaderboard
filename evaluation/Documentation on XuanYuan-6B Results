I evaluated the Duxiaoman-DI/XuanYuan-6B large language model on 35 different tasks, including NER (Named Entity Recognition), and FINER-ORD. The model showed varying performance across these tasks. For example, in NER, the Entity F1 score was 0.0, indicating that the model did not correctly identify any entities. In FINER-ORD, both Entity F1 and overall F1 scores were 0.000, suggesting further improvement is needed for this task. Other tasks, such as SC (Sentiment Classification) and CD (Chunking), also showed areas for improvement. However, some tasks have not yet been completed, so a comprehensive evaluation is still pending. Overall, the results highlight the need for further refinement and training of the Duxiaoman-DI/XuanYuan-6B model to enhance its performance across various NLP tasks.
